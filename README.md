A comprehensive suite of [BackstopJS](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS) scenarios to automate visual regression testing on CiviCRM

:warning: Please note that currently the suite works only on Drupal-based CiviCRM sites. Wordpress and/or Joomla sites are not supported yet

# Requirements
A CiviCRM site with sample data (check the "Load sample data" option when running the installer)

### Technical
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v8.9.0
* [Drush](https://www.drush.org/) installed globally

### Data
* At least one Price Set added with at least one price set (/civicrm/admin/price/), with at least one price field (/civicrm/admin/price/field)
* At least one Batch Data Entry Set with type 'Contribution' (/civicrm/batch/add?reset=1&action=add)
* On Contact search page (/civicrm/contact/search) , the first result should have a valid email address field
* "Adams Family" contact must be added to Administators group (/civicrm/group/search?context=amtg&amtgID=1&reset=1)

### Extensions
* The [uk.co.vedaconsulting.mosaico](https://github.com/veda-consulting/uk.co.vedaconsulting.mosaico) extension should not be enabled on the site. In case it is, either momentarily disable it or remove the *mailings_menu.json* scenarios group
* Enable `CiviCase` component (admin/setting/component?reset=1) which is the part of core vanilla civicrm. The test suite contains screens for civicase component

### Drupal
* [Clean URLs](https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/configuring-clean-urls/enable-clean-urls) enabled
* The user name for admin should be `admin`

# How to use it
1. Create a `backstop_data/site-config.json` file with the following content.
    ```json
    {
      "url": "your_local_url",
      "root": "absolute_path_to_site"
    }
    ```
2. Create the reference screenshots
    ```shell
    npx gulp backstopjs:reference
    ```
3. Create the test screenshots and compare
    ```shell
    npx gulp backstopjs:test
    ```

## Testing a single group
In case you want to run backstop only for the scenarios of a specific group (ie. `administer-menu.json`), pass the `--group` argument to the gulp task (without the `.json` extension)
```shell
npx gulp backstopjs:test --group administer-menu
```

## Parallel capturing
BackstopJS supports taking multiple screenshot at once. Change the value of `asyncCaptureLimit` in _backstop.tpl.json_ to decide how many screenshots you want to take in parallel

***Note**:Please be aware that BackstopJS performance is heavily dependent on the specs of the machine it runs on, so make sure to choose a value that the tool can handle on your machine (otherwise you will encounter random timeout errors)*

## Cookies
This backstop test suite relies on session cookies to be present in the `backstop_data/cookies/admin.json`file. The file is automatically generated by the `gulp` task by using the [`drush uli`](https://drushcommands.com/drush-7x/user/user-login/) command.

If you want to skip the cookie creation phase (in case the cookies are already present in the folder and are not expired yet), pass a `--skipCookies` argument to the task

```shell
npx gulp backstopjs:reference --skipCookies
```
